    <head>DEAR LISHA SAGAR</head>
    <title>REQUESTING PERMISSION!!</title>
    <body bgcolor = "cyan" > 
    <h1>WILL YOU ACCEPT ME AS YOUR BOYFRIEND,<p>AND BE MY GIRLFRIEND</p> </h1>
    <h2>Dear Lisha,</p>I noticed you during MTS. I referred to you as the girl with the pretty eyes and that gahhh damnnn beautiful smile.
        <p>I instantly had a crush on you the day I met you. I asked about you, and within a few minutes, I found your Instagram.</p>
        <p>I was crashing out, contemplating whether I should follow you or not. I swear to God, it was the best decision I’ve ever made in my life.</p>
        <p>I never regretted following you on Instagram. I mean, it’s FREAKING “LISHA SAGAR” — the girl with the beautiful eyes and a smile that’s pretty as hell </p>
            <p>A few days later, I got a notification on my phone: “agentlisha replied to your note.” I literally froze at that moment. I was blushing so hard.</p>
        <p>I didn’t know how to react, so I replied the way any normal person would.</p>
    <p>Days passed. We played ValorI will always love you Lisha,ant. Late nights. Queuing up with you was one of the best decisions I ever made..</p>
<p> Months passed, and I was losing myself. I couldn’t sleep. You were on my mind every single minute.</p>   
<p>Then I had a chance to talk to you in real life for the first time at “Bharkat.” I fell all over again — this time because of your cute voice.</p>
<p>I’ll always be thankful to Bhavessh and Abitha for giving me that chance to talk to you.</p>
<p> You changed the way my days felt without even trying. You became my favorite thought, my calm, and my chaos at the same time.</p>
<p>I will always love you, Lisha, and I will never stop telling you how beautiful you truly are.</p>
<p>No matter the obstacles, I’ll always choose you and fight for our love to stay.</p> </h2>  <!-- about lisha-->
